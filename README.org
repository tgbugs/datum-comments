* datum comments for common lisp
Racket style =#;= comments implemented as a dispatch macro.

#+begin_src lisp
#; ; regular comments are treated as whitespace
(and the next datum is skipped by the reader)
#; (so you can skip a datum inline) (print "and not just a line or block")
#+end_src

* Usage
Since comments are a fundamental part of a language datum-comments automatically
registers itself as a dispatch macro for the =#;= symbol. To enable datum comments
obtain the code from github, or quicklisp, and then include it in the `:use` section
of defpackage where you want to be able to use datum comments, e.g. as

#+begin_src lisp
(defpackage :my-package
  (:use :cl :datum-comments))
#+end_src

at which point you can #;(use datum comments to your heart's content)
